**Command-line script to download videos from KissAnime**
  
  
This script requires [`cfscrape`](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape) and BeautifulSoup4 to work.   
Install using pip `pip install -U cfscrape beautifulsoup4`  
  
    
Please download and install [`resumable-urlretrieve`](https://github.com/berdario/resumable-urlretrieve) to
be able to continue download of partially downloaded files.


**There seems to be an issue with `cloudscrape`. So, this script won't work for the time being.**
